# Final Year Project: Welenium Library

## Introduction

> Developing a new automation library built on top of selenium for simpler and robust automation testing. WeleniumLibrary contains the automation library whilst the UIBox contains both Selenium and Welenium test samples.

## Code Samples

> To run a automation test, run 
```
mvn clean && mvn verify -f UIBox/pom.xml -Dtest=weleniumTests.automationTests
```

## Installation

> You will need to ensure that Glassfish is installed on your machine and deployed to the test websites before execution, this can be done through IntelliJ IDEA.
